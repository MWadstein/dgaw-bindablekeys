# DGAW-BindableKeys

Unreal Engine 4.11 added in a new node for input that will give you the KeyState of any key in Blueprints.  This lets me check at runtime if a key is pressed and if so I can react accordingly.  

Using this I created a very simple and basic system to allow you to bind keys you want to inputs you set up in your blueprint to allow the player to choose what keys they want for your inputs rather than the fixed inputs normally in the engine all in Blueprints.
